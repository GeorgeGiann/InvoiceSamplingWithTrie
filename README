		SamplingWithTries.py
Requested code. First, it creates a trie using customer_sample.csv
code. Then, it uses this trie in irder to recognize the sampled codes
and create the new customer.csv file.
Then a new trie is created related to invoice codes for every invoice 
code that corresponds to the first trie.Those line are being written 
in the new invoice.csv file. 
Lastly,invoice_item.csv lines are being read and every line with invoice code matching
to the stored ones in the second trie is being written in the new invoice_item.csv

To produce requested datasets run: 

$python SamplingWithTries.py
